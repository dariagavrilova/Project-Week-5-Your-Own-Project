## Project Description
Cancellations are one of the biggest problems faced by a hotels. That is why it is so important to understand clients behaviour in order to implement strategies aimed at combating and preventing losses caused by unexpected cancelations.
It is common mind that online travel agencies such as Booking, Expedia, Agoda and etc. are one of the most important part of an a segment market for the hotels. They make process of reservations and cancelations easy and and accessible. So I will try to prove or reject a fact that Online TA are the reason of high cancelation tendency.
